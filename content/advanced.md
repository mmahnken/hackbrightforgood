#Advanced Web Devlopment Resources

###[Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/)
I was craving these bite-sized explanations of web architecture for a long time before I discovered this. It's a series of textbook-esque mini-articles about the "full stack"- it will help you understand servers, static assets, databases, && more. Basically everything that makes a web app. It is like a who's who of technical jargon. 

###[The Twelve Factor App](http://12factor.net/)
Maintained by the folks at Heroku, this is a series of articles about a methodology for making web apps. This 12-factor methology addresses minimizing divergence between already-live code and developing code, the necessities of scaling up without restructuring, deploying on cloud platforms, and a lot more, all with less techno-babble and more technical details. 

###[Atlassian's Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-feature-branch)
This is an extremely important part of building-- having a process for safely adding (and perhaps, undoing) changes that you make. The feature branch workflow is one of a few git workflows. I like it because, frankly, I've never done anything else. Atlassian has a lot of other friendly neighborhood Git resources. Exploring is encouraged.

###[Google Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/)
Gorgeous front-end web fundamentals archive by a company you may have heard of. If you want to make the most modern, intuitive user input form or improve performance on your web out, check out a few of these guides. Google is setting the bar... again. 


###[Dive into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/)
There is a lot of grumbling on the internet, especially when it comes to web development. The near unaninimous absence of grumbling about HTML5, then, should be taken as a sign that it is truly a gift from some celestial being. This resource let's you read about why it is cool and how to use it. It has fun old-timey illustrations, as well.
