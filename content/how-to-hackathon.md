#Hackathons are hard.
I love hackathons. Don't get me wrong. But anything with an abundance of red bull and ideas and a lack of time and planning has a propensity for tears and yelling. Please hackathon responsibly. Remember to eat and take naps. Remember that an [MVP (minimum viable product)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) is an excellent goal. At hackathons, it's fairly common to feel like you've learned a lot and had a few breakthroughs, but have less than you thought you would have to show for it. 

This is a place for learning and collaboration, so please don't stress. Do work hard and get a little too caffeinated if that's your thing, but

At the end, when it comes to communicated to the judges the stuff that maybe your team didn't get to, just draw them out. You can use this site, or Balsamiq as a desktop alternative.
