#Mornin'!
Hey everybody.

At 11:00 a.m., brunch will arrive at HB HQ.

At 11:15 we are going to make announcements about the following items:
+ twilio credit codes 
+ schedule for Sunday (food!)
+ restate projects that teams are working on, and whether they are open to new members
+ open up the floor to anyone with announcements (got a coupon code for your Hackathon peers?)

#To those who wish to demo
If you plan to demo tonight for the judges (beginners and teams welcome!) comment on this thread by 4pm with the name of your team (or some other relevant identifier, like team members' names).

###UPDATE: You will have 2 minutes, instead of the previous 1 minute, to demo your project. Whoopie!
