#Here are my go-to resources for beginners.

###[Grinberg's Mega Tutuorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
This tutorial taught me so much of what I do on a daily basis as a web developer. I shudder to think of myself without it, actually. Each part of the tutorial is a different part of a web app (user login, comments, etc.) It's a Flask tutorial, meaning that it uses a python framework that organizes the big cloud of files that go to make an "app" into an MVC (model view controller) type structure that's easier to use/develop/understand. Hooray!

###[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/preface.html)
The ever-useful Learn Python the Hard Way. Do it once. Then do it twice. Then go on vacation. When you come back, do it again. 

###[Dash by GA](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)
The most gorgeous, clear, yet still free tutorial on HTML/CSS. Made by General Assembly.

###[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)
A set of do-able word problems that are basically impossible (or sufficiently time-consuming) to solve using anything but computer programs. The first problem is "Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000." The get progressively harder after that, but in a linear fashion. 

###[A Visual Guide to Version Control](http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/)
You know git, that thing everyone's always using? It's like hitting save, but more complicated? This guide tells you what's up.

###[LXML Scraping in Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/)
This is what I used to learn how to do web scraping. More popular for scraping is the python library called Beautiful Soup. Remember that if you want dependable information recources, it's better to use an API.
